            French woman in her 30s is in the city. She came to act in a film
            about the Peace. The Story begins the day before this woman returns
            to France, the film she was acting in is more or less done. There's
            just one scene left to shoot.</span></font></font></p>

            Japanese man (engineer, or architect ), and that they will have
            between them a very short love affair. The conditions in which they
            met will never be made clear in the film. Because that's not the
            question. People meet each other all over the world. What matters is
            what follows these everyday encounters.</span></font></font></p>

            everything at HIROSHIMA. We see what she saw. It's horrible.
